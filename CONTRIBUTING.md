## Issues
Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.
When creating a new issue. Please give as much information about your current environment as possible, including :
- Rust version
- oh library version
- piece of code that poses problem

Please do not create "duplicate" issues, as in do not create multiple issues addressing the same problem and do not create a new issue addressing the same problem as an already open issue (especially if it has been created by someone else.)

## Pull requests
Everyone is welcome to create pull requests to implement a new feature **OR** fix a bug **OR** ameliorate some part of the code. One pull request should not (as much as possible) do multiple of these at a time.
In your pull request please specify the nature of the modification (new feature, bug-fix, amelioration), and (optionnally) how you wrote it.
